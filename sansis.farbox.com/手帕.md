Man Ray Revolving Doors handkerchief made by Third Drawer Down Studio using collage artworks created in New York from 1916-1917.  Their first appearance was at the Daniel Gallery in 1919. Hinged on a revolving stand, the prints produced an impressive optical effect as they rotated. The collages were again displayed in 1926, when a series of 105 prints were made, of which this set is number six. The second print of the set has been used, with the blue shape reminiscent of the lute in Man Ray's collage 'Involute'.
